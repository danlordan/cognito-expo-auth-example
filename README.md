# cognito-expo-auth-example
Created to answer feature request at https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/authsession-aws-cognito

This has not yet been submitted to expo docs to udpate the examples, but I plan to in the future. Feel free to use for your own project. The only file is an app.js file that mirrors the `Auth Code` flow at https://docs.expo.io/guides/authentication/ 

Code is provided as is, and should be used as a guide not production code.
